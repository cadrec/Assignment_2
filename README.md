Assignment 2

Using a late day for this assignment

Compile & run in terminal

Disclaimer: Could not finish everything. I think the biggest factor for this was my organization of my code early on. It got very confusing for me in the later stages and I had differnet names for variable and did not organize everything. I spent way too much time trying to back track and fix things. Having learned from this, I think if I had planned out my code better and had ideas in mind on where to put things and keeping things seperate, I would have been able to complete to assignment.
